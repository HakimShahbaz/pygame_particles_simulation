# Pygame Particles Simulation
This is a Python program that simulates particles using the Pygame library. The particles move around randomly and
bounce off the walls of the window.

# Getting Started
To run this program, you will need **Python 3** installed on your computer, as well as the **Pygame** library. You can
install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```


Once you have Python and Pygame installed, you can run the program by navigating to the directory where
`particle_simulation.py` is located and running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python particle_simulation.py
```
